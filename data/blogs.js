        The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 5 parts:
        
        Learn a programming language of your choice
        Learn about Time and Space complexities
        Learn the basics of individual Data Structures and Algorithms
        Practice, Practice, and Practice more
        Compete and Become a Pro
        Before starting any data structure or algorithm you need to know the means to express it or implement it. So, the first task is to learn any programming language. Then you should learn about one of the most important and most used concepts about DSA, the complexity of a program. Now equipped with the prerequisites, you can start learning DSA and at the same time practice it regularly and compete in challenges to gauge and sharpen your ability. In the following sections, we will discuss each of the steps in detail.

1. Learn at least one Programming language
This should be your first step while starting to learn data structure and algorithms. We as human beings, before learning to write a sentence or an essay on a topic, first try to learn that language: the alphabet, letters, and punctuations in it, how and when to use them. The same goes for programming also. 

Firstly, select a language of your choice, be it Java, C, C++, Python, or any other language of your choice. Before learning how to code in that language you should learn about the building pieces of the language: the basic syntax, the data types, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, etc. You may also learn the concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). 
2. Learn about Complexities
Here comes one of the interesting and important topics. The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently. How can you decide if a program written by you is efficient or not? This is measured by complexities. Complexity is of two types:

Time Complexity: Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
Space Complexity: Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code. 
You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.
3. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms
Here comes the most crucial and the most awaited stage of the roadmap for learning data structure and algorithm – the stage where you start learning about DSA. The topic of DSA consists of two parts:

        content: `Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.
        Java is fast, reliable, and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner.
        Java is a simple language: Java is easy to learn and its syntax is clear and concise. It is based on C++ (so it is easier for programmers who know C++). Java has removed many confusing and rarely-used features e.g. explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc. Java also takes care of memory management and it also provides an automatic garbage collector. This collects the unused objects automatically.
Java is a platform-independent language: The programs written in Java language, after compilation, are converted into an intermediate level language called the bytecode which is a part of the Java platform irrespective of the machine on which the programs run. This makes java highly portable as its bytecodes can be run on any machine by an interpreter called the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) and thus java provides ‘reusability of code’.
Java is an object-oriented programming language: OOP makes the complete program simpler by dividing it into a number of objects. The objects can be used as a bridge to have data flow from one function to another. We can easily modify data and function’s as per the requirements of the program.
Java is a robust language: Java programs must be reliable because they are used in both consumer and mission-critical applications, ranging from Blu-ray players to navigation systems.
Java is a multithreaded language: Java can perform many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. For example, a program that manages a Graphical User Interface (GUI) while waiting for input from a network connection uses another thread to perform and wait’s instead of using the default GUI thread for both tasks. This keeps the GUI responsive.
Java programs can create applets: Applets are programs that run in web browsers. But applets support was deprecated in Java 9 release and has been removed in Java 11 release due to waning browser support for the Java plugin.
Java does not require any preprocessor: It does not require inclusion of header files for creating a Java application.`,

        description: "Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.",
        content: `Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. It involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries and has a wide range of applications, from virtual personal assistants to self-driving cars.

        Before leading to the meaning of artificial intelligence let understand what is the meaning of Intelligence- 
        
        Intelligence: The ability to learn and solve problems. This definition is taken from webster’s Dictionary. 
        
        The most common answer that one expects is “to make computers intelligent so that they can act intelligently!”, but the question is how much intelligent? How can one judge intelligence? 
        
        …as intelligent as humans. If the computers can, somehow, solve real-world problems, by improving on their own from past experiences, they would be called “intelligent”. 
Thus, the AI systems are more generic(rather than specific), can “think” and are more flexible. 

Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure(training). Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural(i.e., human beings) ‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained through exposure.”

Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, and methods based on probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, artificial psychology, and many others. 

The main focus of artificial intelligence is towards understanding human behavior and performance. This can be done by creating computers with human-like intelligence and capabilities. This includes natural language processing, facial analysis and robotics. The main applications of AI are in military, healthcare, and computing; however, it’s expected that these applications will start soon and become part of our everyday lives.

Many theorists believe that computers will one day surpass human intelligence; they’ll be able to learn faster, process information more effectively and make decisions faster than humans. However, it’s still a work in progress as there are many limitations to how much artificial intelligence is achieved. For example, computers don’t perform well in dangerous or cold environments; they also struggle with physical tasks such as driving cars or operating heavy machinery. Even so, there are many exciting things ahead for artificial intelligence!

Uses of Artificial Intelligence :

Artificial Intelligence has many practical applications across various industries and domains, including:

        content: `How can I start learning web development? Is it easy? And how can I keep up with the latest web designing technologies? These are the questions that appear in every beginner’s mind. There is also confusion between web designing and web development, but we’ll talk about web development. 

        It totally depends on how much you are interested in and are serious about it. if you desperately wanted to learn then you can easily be an expert on it. There’s nothing like it’s so hard or something like it’s so difficult to design websites like we use or look around our day-to-day life. e.g: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, and many more. 
        
        But if we really think about it, Scaring is natural, comes to mind when we look at it as a bunch of graphical elements like different colors, different kinds of fonts, images, Card views, Tables, Animations, etc. and the most interesting one is the term called ‘Responsive’ websites, responsive websites are those websites which change it’s element’s alignments, spacing, etc according to the device it’s browsing. 
        
        Start to learn Web Development
        
        
        But nowadays it’s not a very hard concept anymore, you can easily design your website responsive with the help of some predefined libraries, we have so many types of frameworks available for designing websites and the best thing is that it’s all freely available to use, you just need to learn ‘How to use it. Now if you are wondering about how to learn it then just don’t worry about it. I am sharing one of the best sources available on the Internet to learn all these things freely and easily, you just need to follow it and practice it own. If you are reading this Blog then definitely you want to become a website developer, really want to become a developer. Waw! it’s really dame true, to learn website designing web is the best place you will ever have.
        
        It will be something like you no need to study theory concepts of something first then do the practice of that, what actually we all do during our academics. You will learn the concept with the whole details about the effect of that learning. You will see all different kinds of things that developed day by day and when you will observe it, you want to do it yourself which emphasizes you to learn more day by day.
